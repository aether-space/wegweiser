Wegweiser
=========

Wegweiser is a `Sphinx`_ extension for autogenerating documentation
for `Pyramid`_ applications. It generates documentation for the
application's routes using the views' docstrings.


Limitations
===========

* Wegweiser currently only supports `URL dispatch routes
  <http://pyramid.readthedocs.org/en/latest/glossary.html#term-url-dispatch>`_,
  no traversal.
* Multi-views aren't supported


Documentation
=============

Either read it online at http://buffer.io/+wegweiser/docs/dev/ or
built it yourself from the Sphinx sources in the ``docs`` directory.


Development
===========
